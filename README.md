I long stopped playing rimworld myself and probably won&apos;t update any of these. Source code is included in the mod file and anyone can update and reupload without asking me for permissions. This mod will stay up for v1.0.

============================================================

I can save you 6 seconds of life.

This mod made it so that you won&apos;t have to wait for 6 seconds on the author confirm dialog window while uploading something to workshop. Just click &quot;Yes&quot; twice and directly upload.

# This mod won&apos;t do anything if you don&apos;t need to upload anything to workshop.


Incompatibility: None
Old Save Compatible: Yes
Safely Removable: Yes
